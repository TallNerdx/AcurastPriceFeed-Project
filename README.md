# AcurastPriceFeed
This was inspired by and is a modification of the [Limitless Compute: Access to a Decentralized Cloud](https://youtu.be/eNySIW9cBD8) workshop.

## Explanation (Modification)
* A processor on Acurast gets the price feed for BTC/USDT.
* Sends or provides this feed to external contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.
* Checks the current block stamp price against the last updated price.
* Reverts if this difference exceeds 1 hour with a 'Price is Outdated' error message.
