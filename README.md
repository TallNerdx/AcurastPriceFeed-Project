# AcurastPriceFeed
This was inspired by and is a modification of the [Limitless Compute: Access to a Decentralized Cloud](https://youtu.be/eNySIW9cBD8) workshop.

## Explanation (Modification)
* A processor on Acurast gets the price feed for BTC/USDT.
* Sends or provides this feed to external contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.
* Checks the price and reverts if it's more than 1 hour.
